    // Disadvantage of writing php code using shorthands is these are not automatically turned on in all Apache servers. We need to manually go to the 'php.ini' file and turn them on so that server can render the file. If you share such code with shorthands with someone else it may not run on his/her computer because of the same configuration issue.
