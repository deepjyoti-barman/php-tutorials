        // The whole idea is to import variables from a file (.php) and use that variable in numerous places of one or multiple webpages. Thus later on at some point of time in the future if we need some modification we can do it in just one place and changes will be reflecting in all other pages. This will reduce the overhead of going to each file and doing the modification there, which is quite error prone and maintenance of such pages are not easy.
